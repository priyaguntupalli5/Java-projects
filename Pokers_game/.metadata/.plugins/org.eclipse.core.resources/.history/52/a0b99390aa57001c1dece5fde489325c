/* A version of the solitaire game "Poker Squares" with variable point systems.
 * Author: Todd W. Neller

Notes: 

A Poker Squares grid is represented as a 5-by-5 array of Card objects.  A null indicates an empty position.
In the solitaire game of Poker Squares, a deck is initially shuffled.
Each turn, the player draws a card from the deck and places it in any empty cell of a 5-by-5 grid.  Once placed, cards may not be moved.
After the last cell is filled, each row and column are scored according to a point system for Poker Squares hands.
For example, the American system is as follows:
100 - Royal Flush: A T-J-Q-K-A sequence all of the same suit. Example: TC, JC, QC, KC, AC.
75 - Straight Flush: Five cards in sequence all of the same suit. Example: AD, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D.
50 - Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same rank. Example: 9C, 9D, 9H, 9S, 6H.
25 - Full House: Three cards of one rank with two cards of another rank. Example: 7S, 7C, 7D, 8H, 8S.
20 - Flush: Five cards all of the same suit. Example: AH, 2H, 3H, 5H, 8H.
15 - Straight: Five cards in sequence. Aces may be high or low but not both. (Straights do not wrap around.) Example: 8C, 9S, TH, JD, QC.
10 - Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank. Example: 2S, 2H, 2D, 5C, 7S.
5 - Two Pair: Two cards of one rank with two cards of another rank. Example: 3H, 3D, 4C, 4S, AC.
2 - One Pair: Two cards of one rank.  Example: 5D, 5H, TC, QS, AH.
(0 otherwise)

The player's total score is the sum of the scores for each of the 10 row and column hands.

For our purposes, a player is considered better if it has a higher expected game score, i.e. has a higher score average over many games.

In our implementation, each turn a PokerSquaresPlayer will be passed (1) a Card object and (2) the number of milliseconds remaining in the game, 
and will return a length 2 integer array with the row and column the player placed the card.  In the event that the player makes an illegal 
play or "times out", i.e. runs out of time for play, the player loses with a final score of 10 times the minimum hand score.

This file contains not only the code to run a simple demonstration game with a random player, but also code to perform batch game testing,
and tournament evaluation.
